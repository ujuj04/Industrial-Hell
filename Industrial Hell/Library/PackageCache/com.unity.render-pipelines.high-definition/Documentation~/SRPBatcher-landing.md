# Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP) Batcher

Resources for using the Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP) Batcher to reduce the number of render state changes between draw calls.

| **Page** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| [Introduction to the SRP Batcher](SRPBatcher.md) | Understand how the SRP Batcher reduces render state changes between draw calls. |
| [Check whether a GameObject is compatible with the SRP Batcher](SRPBatcher-Materials.md) | Find out if Unity can include a GameObject and a shader in the SRP Batcher. |
| [Enable the SRP Batcher](SRPBatcher-Enable.md) | Enable the SRP Batcher in the HDRP Asset. |
| [Troubleshoot the SRP Batcher](SRPBatcher-Profile.md) | Use the Frame Debugger to solve common issues with the SRP Batcher, such as a low number of draw calls in batches. |
| [Remove SRP Batcher compatibility for GameObjects](SRPBatcher-Incompatible.md) | Make a shader or renderer incompatible with the SRP Batcher, for example if you want to use [GPU instancing](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/GPUInstancing.md). |
